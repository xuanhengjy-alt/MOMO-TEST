This professional test, through 70 carefully designed questions, helps you scientifically assess the extroverted and introverted traits in your personality.

Whether you are good at contemplation or passionate about expression, this test will assist you in better planning your career path, optimizing your social approach, and achieving more composed growth based on self-awareness.\n\nAre you ready to have a 15-minute conversation with your true self?',

Therefore, you feel very comfortable and at ease in your own family environment and among your close friends. You may tend to avoid others, even those who are very close to you, and shut yourself in your own small world. Of course, you can do this, and you may even need to do so, as it is beneficial for you to have your own world and cultivate a unique self. However, you should understand that those who like you and love you want to listen to your difficulties and are always ready to help you, because you may have some negative emotions at any time. Keeping these negative emotions deep inside you and always swallowing your unhappiness is not good for you. It is always beneficial for you to confide your difficulties to kind-hearted people. There are always some people around you who are willing to approach you and are very willing to listen to you.\n\nYou belong to the type of people who are deeply contemplative, with thoughts that are quite profound. You are extremely concerned about the fate of humanity and global issues. Because of this, what you contribute to society is likely to far exceed your own estimation. Your meticulousness and focused emotions provide you with a powerful inner strength, which is worth remembering carefully, especially when you feel shy or are with people you think are smarter, more agile, or more noble than you, making you feel extremely depressed.\n\nBecause you are timid and shy, you may very much envy those who are talkative and charming, and you may want to imitate them. However, you should understand that you need to bring out the advantages of your inner calmness and steadiness, and use this characteristic to develop your personality. This is the best way for you to improve yourself. You would rather occasionally utter some profound clich√©s than speak rashly and talk freely. Such a lively personality is definitely not what you should have."

You would never take any unnecessary risks and always believe that prevention is better than cure. You plan your life based on your preference for tranquility. You are a diligent and unexciting doer and think that to achieve your modest ambitions or aspirations, you need to make progress step by step.\n\nYou often feel very uncomfortable and at ease, because the noisy clubs are not set up for you, and going out for a noisy night with a girl or a boy is not for you either. You'd better try your best to avoid such occasions, otherwise, you will feel very embarrassed and even distressed. Instead, you can do many other things that suit you.\n\nYou may enjoy the type of work that both challenges your mind and makes you feel calm. However, don't be too isolated. For instance, if you still like listening to people debate, you might as well occasionally join in the discussion or argument.\n\nYou still worry a lot. If this is your nature, no one's advice will be of any use. Anyway, please remember that to solve the problems that arise, just thinking about them with your mind is not enough; you must also adopt other methods. Of course, you should carefully analyze all the details of the problem. But you might as well try to use your instinctive intuition. All kinds of methods will be effective. You may be able to compare the pros and cons, weigh the advantages and disadvantages, and distinguish right from wrong, or you may be able to make some decisive decisions driven by the power of your instincts."

You probably love life very much and enjoy its pleasures to the fullest. You are very ambitious, but when it comes to seizing and taking advantage of various opportunities that come up on the road of life, you tend to be a bit timid. In public, you are at ease and talk freely. If you are at a competition, you will cheer for your team; in business, work and social activities, you like to compete with your opponents, and in this way, your natural vitality and enthusiasm will be fully and positively exerted.\n\nBoth in your work and in your spare time, your interests are too wide-ranging. You should pay attention to overcoming this habit, which is very necessary for you. Otherwise, your original versatility will eventually come to nothing and you will end up knowing a little about everything but being good at nothing. You should not have the idea that \"other people's industries are better\", and even less should you be driven by such an idea, which may cause the promising career in your hands to be abandoned halfway.\n\nYou need to constantly cultivate your patience. You may be able to control yourself and get rid of the habit of interrupting others, but limited self-control and abundant energy often force you to lose control. Do some deep breathing exercises frequently and take some time to meditate. How will you walk through this life journey? What is your life goal? If you add strong belief to your lively and eloquent nature, you will achieve success.\n\nPeople usually rely on you to do some organizational work, and you do it well indeed. However, meticulous work is not your forte. If you join a committee, you can definitely be a leader and hold a key position, but you should entrust the specific tasks that require carefulness to those who have strong analytical skills, are cautious and methodical. In many cases, you seem like a breath of fresh air to others, but it is very important that you do not lose the opportunity to listen to their opinions."

Your ambitions reach the sky, and of course, you are well aware of how to achieve them. If you go into business, your rivals will be defeated like a defeated army at your hands.\n\nFirst of all, you will most likely focus your main time and energy on winning, such as participating in football matches, competing with your chosen partner, and so on. You will regard all these as extremely important things to do. Due to your strong competitive spirit and unwavering belief, you must constantly remind yourself not to hurt others on your way to achieving your goals. You can easily do this with a little attention. Otherwise, you will be shocked when your opponents complain about you. It is unlikely that you can consciously forget all these influences. You will also spend a lot of time making many promises and explanations.\n\nYou possess many admirable and even enviable qualities. You are bold and courageous, passionate and generous. However, it is precisely because of your positivity and decisiveness that there will be some blanks in your life and you will lose many things. For instance, you simply cannot spare time to carefully ponder over some issues. It would be better for you to inspire more and better inspiration in terms of emotions and intellect. If you often calm down and reflect on your own psychology, your thoughts will become deeper and your personality will be a perfect whole. Therefore, try to think twice before you act!"
