For people of ISTJ type, it is very difficult to see that ‘the feeling they need is different from their own’.

Others will see an ISTJ type person as: Calm, self-controlled, serious Consistent, orderly Traditional value judgments Potential areas for growth Sometimes life circumstances do not offer ISTJ types the opportunity to develop and express their thoughts and feelings. If their thinking doesn't develop, an ISTJ may not find a reliable way to deal with the world; instead, they may focus on their internal memories If their senses do not develop, they may make judgments and act prematurely without thinking about new information If an ISTJ type person can't find a place where they can use their talents or where their contributions are not applied, they often feel frustrated and may: Start to become rigid about time, planning, and the routine of doing things - following the book Nitpicking and over-criticizing others Finding it hard to take on a commission -- not believing that someone else can do a job fairly For ISTJ types, it's normal to invest less effort in intuitive and emotional areas they don't prefer, but if they ignore these too much, they may: They may not see the broad branches and expedient approaches to trends They focus too much on logic and do not value the influence of others They do not properly respect others' need for friendliness and closeness Under significant pressure, people of ISTJ type do not have the calm and reasonable judgment they are accustomed to, and they will undergo mutations - imagining many possibilities that are unfavorable to themselves and others.

Seeking solutions to real problems from past successful experiences, over time they will become proficient in even the tiniest elements of the work.
